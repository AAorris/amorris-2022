# Digital Urbanism

## New urbanism

[New urbanism (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Urbanism)

> We advocate the restructuring of public policy and
> development practices to support the following principles:
>
> - neighborhoods should be diverse in use and population;
> - communities should be designed for the pedestrian and transit as well as the car;
> - cities and towns should be shaped by physically defined and universally accessible public spaces and community institutions;
> - urban places should be framed by architecture and landscape design that celebrate local history, climate, ecology, and building practice.

## Maps onto small tech

- [Small Tech](https://small-tech.org/research-and-development/)
- [Convival computing](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3397537.3397544)
- [Salvage Computing](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/salvage_computing.html)
- [Collapse informatics](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2493431)

Where small tech and convival computing target accessibility and community,
and salvage computing and collapse informatics target sustainability and resilience.

These topics are reactions. Reactions to the digital world becoming
increasingly centralized into centralized points, becoming less accessible,
producing too much waste, and growing too fast to maintain itself.

These reactions, and these principles (accessibility, community, sustainability, resilience)
feel well captured in my mind as a digital form of new urbanism. Digital urbanism.

## Creating Digital Urbanism

- apps -> tools, which solve a small set of problems well
- platforms -> communities, decentralized deglobalized
- localization -> internet cultures and subcultures
- resilience -> should survive government disapproval, function on self-hosted infrastructure
- sustainability -> should run on small/old computers, be backwards compatible
- spatial metaphor -> should build "spaces" for "communities" where humans gather
- aesthetic metaphor -> should have a look and feel that can be appreciated and identified
